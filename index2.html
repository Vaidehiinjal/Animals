    <h1> Himalayan Tahr of Table Mountain </h1>
    <h2> About the Himalayan Tahr </h2> 
    <h3 class="CB"> Have you ever spotted a strange goat-like 
        creature trotting the Table Mountain slopes? If so, you've 
        come upon the Himalayan Tahr (Hemitragus jemlahicus), a big 
        ungulate (hoofed animal) native to Northern India, Tibet, China, 
        and Nepal. The tale of how these exotic "wild goats" ended up on 
        Table Mountain is a fascinating one. The Groote Schuur Zoo was founded in 
        the 1930s on the slopes of Table Mountain near the University of Cape Town. 
        It spanned two hectares of land and housed a variety of species, 
        including lions, crocodiles, emus, and tahrs, two of which escaped. 
        A number of factors contributed to the Himalayan Tahr's success as 
        an invasive species when it was roaming free.To begin with, Table Mountain 
        and the tahr's original Himalayan habitat - steep, stony mountain cliffs 
        bordered by woods and scrub – are strikingly similar. Second, the lack of 
        predators on Table Mountain (in comparison to the Snow Leopard's original region) 
        has meant that tahr population growth has been constrained primarily by access to 
        food and water, as well as the animal's own reproductive rate. The tahr's versatile 
        digestive system, which allows it to eat a wide variety of vegetation, is a third 
        contributing element. This, combined with the animal's extraordinary mobility, 
        has ensured that it has consistent access to food and water</h3>
